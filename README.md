Overview:
    Our app is designed to help people find forgotten/hidden places. Our team is deeply invested in the user experience and our app will allow a user to create an account where they will be able to post a location with details such as photos, descriptions, directions, and what they love about it. The places can be forgotten parks, mom and pop restaurants, or hidden spots inside a city. Any user will be able to see all the locations but only a user who has an account and is signed in will be able to make a post. Each user will also only be able to edit or delete the post that they themselves create. 

Features:
    As a user you have the option to sign up or in.
    An unregistered user can only see an index of locations and details on any specific location.
    A registered user has full CRUD capabilities on their posts.
